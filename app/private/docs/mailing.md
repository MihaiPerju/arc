Mailing
======

Emails are rendered server-side from react components and sent via the default *Email* API:
https://docs.meteor.com/api/email.html

To play with emails you need to listen to an event. And from anywhere in the code dispatch the events.

Step 1:
- Look at the sample file: `/imports/api/mailing/templates/Sample.jsx`

Step 2:
- Add it into index.js loading: `/imports/mailing/index.js`
